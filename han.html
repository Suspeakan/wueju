      Whenever I post anything about Sáir Ju online, there is, seemingly always, (at least) one person, who says something along the line of "this looks like broken Chinese" or perhaps they ask why the language uses Chinese characters when the "vocabulary isn't derived". This page will respond to these kinds of statements and questions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b>(1): Sáir Ju is not Chinese</b>
    </p>
    <p>This is evident if you read the <a href="index.html">grammar</a> which is the entire index page. Sáir Ju is monosyllabic and minimalistic, it forms and orders phrases differently from Chinese, there is different linguistic logic used; Chinese is (a group of languages and so forth, but I  mean the modern standardized form) a natural language, Sáir Ju is artificial. Much of the claim of similarity to Chinese comes from the writing system, which brings me to point two:</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b>(2): The Writing System</b>
    </p>
    <p>The writing system has always been the main point of contention in the language, it even trumps the problems of communicating complex things, in a language where minimalism is a major goal. Back when the language was made in summer 2022, "Chinese" was part of the phonoaesthetic I was going for, and Han characters seemed to fit well with my monosyllabic language, so I started assigning characters to words. I used the <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary">MDBG Chinsese Dictionary</a> to find words and, generally, I would choose what characters matched the meaning I needed, which was always broad concepts (again, minimalism, monosyllabacy).</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, I would have looked up <a href="https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=air">"air" in MDBG</a> and got various results, but I turned my attention to <b>空调 kōngtiáo</b>, <b>空 kōng</b>, and <b>空气 kōngqì</b>; seeing a pattern, I used the character <b>空</b> for the word <i>koing</i>, which, on the <a href="index.html">index</a> means <i>air, breathe, wind, blow</i>. This is generally how every assignment of a character worked, and some were/are, naturally, pretty poor, as, again, these are two very different languages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is obviously not a wonderful system, but it works, as, you could technically assign a number to every word in Sáir Ju and it be the exact same thing, it is just mapping each syllable to a representation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b>(3): What will I do?</b>
    </p>
    <p>I won't drop using Chinsese characters for Sáir Ju, it isn't like I am commiting some sort of cardinal sin for using them inadequately, plenty of conlangers use various writing systems "inadequately", that is to say, in a way that doesn't match the real world languages which use it—but keep in mind, we are dealing with fictional languages, not anything that make waves.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I do lean towards using the Latin script for writing Sáir Ju in one-off or large translations but even then I may use Chinese characters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will be including a notice on every subsequent post about Sáir Ju on social media (such as reddit), that uses Chinese characters, to NOT say things like "it looks like broken chinese" and "why use Chinese/Han characters?".</p>
